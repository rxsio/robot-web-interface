 * Session states enumeration.<br>

 * @readonly
 * @property {0} idle - Default state when creating a new session, goes to <i>connecting</i> when starting
 * the session.
 * @property {1} connecting - Session is trying to connect to remote peers, goes to <i>streaming</i> in case of
 * success or <i>closed</i> in case of error.
 * @property {2} streaming - Session is correctly connected to remote peers and currently streaming audio/video, goes
 * to <i>closed</i> when any peer closes the session.
 * @property {3} closed - Session is closed and can be garbage collected, state will not change anymore.
